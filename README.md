#### Brief Summary

This is a simple adapter to integrate [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) (an open source proof-reading program) into Sublime Text 2/3.

From https://www.languagetool.org/:

> LanguageTool is an Open Source proof­reading program for English, French, German, Polish, and more than 20 other languages. It finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect and several grammar problems.

#### Installation

If you're using Package Control then open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+p`), type `install`, press Enter then type `languagetool` and press Enter again. Otherwise you can install manually by going to your packages directory (`Ctrl+Shift+p`, type `browse` and press Enter) and cloning the repo there.

#### Usage

Open the file you want to proof-read then:

1. Run a language check (`Ctrl+Shift+c`). Any problems identified by LanguageTool will be highlighted.
2. Move focus between the problems using `Alt+Down` (next) and `Alt+Up` (previous).
3. A panel at the bottom will display a brief description  of the highlighted problem and suggest corrections if available.
4. Begin typing to correct a selected problem or press `Alt+f` to apply the suggested correction.
5. To ignore the selected problem, press `Alt+d`.
6. Auto-correcting a problem (`Alt+f`) or ignoring it (`Alt+d`) will automatically move focus to the next problem.

All plugin commands and their keyboard shortcuts can be listed in the command palette by typing `LanguageTool:`.

#### Server Configuration

The adapter sends the text to be checked to a LanguageTool server via https. The server is initially configured (in the file `LanguageTool.sublime-settings`) as `https://languagetool.org:8081/`. There are few limitations on checking texts using this public server including:

1. Maximum text size of 50Kb
2. Access limited to 20 requests/minute per IP

(See http://wiki.languagetool.org/public-http-api for full details.)

For better performance and to check texts without the above limitations you can download LanguageTool then run and configure the adapter to use [your own LanguageTool server](http://wiki.languagetool.org/http-server).

#### Contributing

Feel free to fork and improve. I tried to keep things neat and tidy but I've never coded in python and have little experience with sublime so please forgive any coding idiosyncrasies.
